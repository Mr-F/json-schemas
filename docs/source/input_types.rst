Input Types
===========

Input types are a concept to allow the form designer to suggest what sort of input type might be appropriate for the
rendering client to use when using HTML.  This does not mean that the consumer will use these items, for example where
the schema is being rendered outside of a web page.  As such input types typically map to a HTML input type or HTML tag.
There are some input types values which don't map directly to a HTML equivalent type or tag.

Where possibly we advise against creating new input types, but there is not stopping you from doing so.  However, the
concept behind the library is to try and maintain easy of use for parties that are not familiar with the project by
providing similar values that they will be familiar without.  If additional information is needed then these can often
be provided through the use of other variables.
